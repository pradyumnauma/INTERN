<h2>Notes:</h2>             
<p>Holding a degree in one of the arts or humanities is a sign of a broad education spanning social sciences, arts, language, and history. This person has an open mind to differing views, backgrounds, and beliefs. Arts and humanities teach critical thinking skills, analysis, research, and problem solving. These majors foster a deeper sense of self, a love of knowledge, and independent thinking. Students learn to adapt their expectations and achieve flexibility in any endeavor. They have excellent skills in writing, speaking, reading, and communicating.

                Explore any university’s Liberal Arts programs, and you find hundreds of interesting choices. Consider majoring in Creative Writing or Art History. Perhaps Sign Language or Theater Design fit best. Other options include Classic Antiquity, Middle-Eastern Studies, Gender and Sexuality, African-American Studies, Public Administration, and Jazz Studies. Master a difficult language like Mandarin or Hungarian. Delve into Latin American Studies. Become a master sculptor or metalsmith. Let your interests guide you.
                
                If your interest is piqued by the vast array of career possibilities for Liberal Arts and Humanities majors, go for it. Do what makes you happiest. Graduates have translated these skills into unexpected careers. A Women’s Studies major might apply to law or medical school, for example. And business leaders like Mark Cuban and Google’s Jonathan Rosenberg say that degrees in the liberal arts and humanities are more valuable for “future-proofing” your career than anything else. In fact, Cuban even says that if he were just starting college now, he’d major in philosophy over accounting.

<p>How Much Money Can You Make If You Study Arts & Humanities?
                Since there are so many subjects to choose from when you study the Arts & Humanities, there is quite a bit of variation in salaries and job markets. Statisticians, for instance, make about $80,500 a year. This is a career that you can start with a Bachelor’s degree while earning a Master’s, and which is projected to see a 34 percent increase in jobs by 2024. Interpreters and translators have one of the most in-demand jobs. While pay is lower, with a median salary of $46,120, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) anticipates 17,500 new jobs in the next seven years. That is a spike of 29 percent. Students looking into fields such as fashion design will find New York and California to be the most job-friendly states. And Georgia, Massachusetts, and New York offer the highest median salaries, of around $70,000. Though when cost-of-living is taken into account, Georgia and Utah offer the best ratio of average salary to cost-of-living.
                
                Job Growth
                A job growth rate of 27% is expected for web designers in the next decade.
                
                What Arts & Humanities Degrees Are Available?
                An Associate’s Degree generally paves the way toward a Bachelor’s degree, though it’s not necessary if you’re going straight into a Bachelor’s program. With just two years of study, students can choose a single concentration such as music, history, or art. An Associate in Graphic Arts earns upwards of $37,850. An Associate’s degree in Textile Design could result in an average of $67,000.
                
                The Bachelor’s Degree allows a broad spectrum of interests, which could lead to Interdisciplinary Studies or a double major. The first two years tackle general education requirements in math, science, language, English, and social sciences. Many of these classes fall under the Arts and Humanities umbrella. Take these opportunities to explore interests before declaring a major. The National Association of Colleges and Employers issued an April 2017 report on Bachelor’s degrees in Humanities with the highest starting salaries.

<p>A Liberal Arts or General Studies diploma merits an average income of $51,100. English Language or Literature graduates earn an average of $50,125. Following those two are Visual and Performing Arts ($48,714), History ($47,500), Foreign Language or Literature ($47,000), and Philosophy ($47,000).
                
                Master’s Degrees lead to positions in higher education, or as head librarians, historians and art critics. Master’s programs usually require a thesis or a capstone project. A Master’s in Sociology leads to a starting wage of $57,080. Time Magazine lists average earnings with both a graduate degree and ten years of experience. The salaries range from $100,000 to $138,000. And if you really love books, you could go for a doctorate.
                
                A PhD candidate prepares a dissertation on a topic of special interest. Instead of studying something general like English Literature, the subject may be “Humanism and Chivalry in French Renaissance Literature.” A PhD opens the door to careers as professors and researchers, directors of nonprofits, and managing editors. A PhD earns approximately 10 to 17 percent more than a Master’s degree holder.
